<p>In the UK there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a precedence for this, so you might find a doctor who makes you go through a psych eval, or you might find one which doesn&rsquo;t require that like Elena Prousskaia. However, afaik there are some legal restrictions. They aren&rsquo;t able to remove all the breast tissue or the nipples, as otherwise it counts as a mastectomy.</p>
<h2 id="us-based">
  US based
  <a class="anchor" href="#us-based">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In the states you have less government focused medical gatekeeping, as there are surgeons who can do top surgery on an informed consent basis, however there is greater medical gatekeeping from insurance companies. You can attempt to get this covered from a gender perspective, in which case you may run into trouble with outdated guidance stating that only top is covered for binary trans men, or with coding problems. The other approach is to attempt it from a back pain perspective which may require extensive documentation of attempts to fix the problem in other ways, such as 6 months of physical therapy.</p>
<h2 id="general-advice">
  general advice
  <a class="anchor" href="#general-advice">#</a>
</h2>
<p>No matter how you try to get it covered or if you&rsquo;re in the UK/US, make sure that you go to a doctor who is always on board with what you want to do with your body. Trans friendly surgeons seem the most reliable in this regards. There are way too many doctors who will enforce their ideas of proportionality and aesthetics onto people. Doctors can also be reluctant to do free nipple grafts.</p>
<p>My advice is to take the lead, bring in pictures and ask if they can do it. Ask if they can do it with or without a free nipple graft, and ask about your breast footprint and the impact of your personal footprint on the results at different amounts of projection. Only go to a surgeon who is completely on board, and is only telling you the medical and aesthetic consequences of your decision. Make sure you talk about shape as well as size, if you have a preference for being flat over being perky or vice versa.</p>
