      <description>Review and summary of Transgender - Theology, Ministry and Communities of Faith by Justin Tanis #  Review #  Transgender - Theology, Ministry and Communities of Faith was published in 2003, after starting life as Justin&amp;rsquo;s doctoral thesis. Despite being a little outdated in it&amp;rsquo;s language and its lack of focus on the non-binary experience, it is an excellent text, and gives a marvelous introduction to many of the themes of trans and queer theology.</description>
