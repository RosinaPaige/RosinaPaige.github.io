<p>I used a iron on transfer pencil to put the face design onto the reverse side, then basted a guide running stitch before using a 4 strand stem stitch. I&rsquo;m really happy with how it turned out. If I sold this plush I would offer a range of expressions since the opm style is so simplistic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also very happy with how the body turned out.</p>
<p>If I did this plush again I would put the buttons for the cape lower down as to give the cape more space between the button and the neck. I would also do the buttonholes properly with stabilizer instead of just winging it, as they&rsquo;re the ugliest part of the plush.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little worried about the thread holding the zip in place, it might fall out, however the zip wont be lost as it is securely sewn in and this is going to be a display plush only. I wish I could figure out how to put a real zip in there but I didn&rsquo;t want to figure that out.</p>
