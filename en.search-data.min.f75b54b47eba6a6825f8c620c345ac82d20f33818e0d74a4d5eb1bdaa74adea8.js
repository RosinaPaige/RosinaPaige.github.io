I added the pink neck by sandwiching the nude fabric between the head and body at the attaching stage, and then left it hanging until the plush was stuffed so that I could see the shape to hand embroider it on.\nI used a iron on transfer pencil to put the face design onto the reverse side, then basted a guide running stitch before using a 4 strand stem stitch. I\u0026rsquo;m really happy with how it turned out. If I sold this plush I would offer a range of expressions since the opm style is so simplistic.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also very happy with how the body turned out.\nIf I did this plush again I would put the buttons for the cape lower down as to give the cape more space between the button and the neck. I would also do the buttonholes properly with stabilizer instead of just winging it, as they\u0026rsquo;re the ugliest part of the plush.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a little worried about the thread holding the zip in place, it might fall out, however the zip wont be lost as it is securely sewn in and this is going to be a display plush only. I wish I could figure out how to put a real zip in there but I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to figure that out.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/sewing/','title':"Sewing",'content':""});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/sewing/izuku_midoriya/','title':"my hero academia Izuku Midoriya",'content':"Pattern by Choly Knight\nI improvised on the pattern a little bit by adding the stick up hair in the seam between the face and the scalp. This gave me a bit of trouble with the head back pieces because I didn\u0026rsquo;t adapt them, I ended up making the scalp piece smaller and had trouble making the top of the head round.\nI considered giving him more hair but it took me 2 tries to get the shapes I got on the fringe so I was fed up and decided not to. Ladder stitching on the back of the head is puckered.\nI\u0026rsquo;m happy with the eyes. The mouth is couch embroidered in but that didn\u0026rsquo;t work for the eyebrows so I just plain hand embroidered them.\nEvery day I regretted making him real clothes more and more. I used the tights pattern from the fairy expansion, and adapted the sweater pattern to be more closely fit to the body. I wanted to do an invisible zip but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a tutorial on how to do it by hand, all the tutorials said to use a special sewing machine foot.\nI like the bias tape for the straight lines, but didn\u0026rsquo;t put enough pre-thought into how to embroider on the front design and don\u0026rsquo;t like the hand done satin stitch. I like the belt but not the shoes.\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/sewing/squid_pouch/','title':"Squid Pouch",'content':"Pattern by Choly Knight\n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':""});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/reduction/','title':"Radical Reduction Guide",'content':"images #  These are all the publicly available images of radical reduction to a A/B that I have found so far.

However, afaik there are some legal restrictions. They aren\u0026rsquo;t able to remove all the breast tissue or the nipples, as otherwise it counts as a mastectomy.\nUS based #  In the states you have less government focused medical gatekeeping, as there are surgeons who can do top surgery on an informed consent basis, however there is greater medical gatekeeping from insurance companies. You can attempt to get this covered from a gender perspective, in which case you may run into trouble with outdated guidance stating that only top is covered for binary trans men, or with coding problems. The other approach is to attempt it from a back pain perspective which may require extensive documentation of attempts to fix the problem in other ways, such as 6 months of physical therapy.\ngeneral advice #  No matter how you try to get it covered or if you\u0026rsquo;re in the UK/US, make sure that you go to a doctor who is always on board with what you want to do with your body. Trans friendly surgeons seem the most reliable in this regards. There are way too many doctors who will enforce their ideas of proportionality and aesthetics onto people. Doctors can also be reluctant to do free nipple grafts.\nMy advice is to take the lead, bring in pictures and ask if they can do it. Ask if they can do it with or without a free nipple graft, and ask about your breast footprint and the impact of your personal footprint on the results at different amounts of projection. Only go to a surgeon who is completely on board, and is only telling you the medical and aesthetic consequences of your decision. Make sure you talk about shape as well as size, if you have a preference for being flat over being perky or vice versa.\nquestions #  Will I need a FNG Will I need lipo/extended scars\nsupplies #  post op supportive underwear u shaped pillow wedge pillow baby wipes butt wiper or bidet\nstool softner probiotics\nsilicon tape\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/the_list/','title':"The List",'content':"The list #     Interest Potential Reading Material     Christian Mysticism Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism    Revelations of Divine Love (Penguin Classics) by Julian of Norwich   Liberation theology On the Side of the Poor: The Theology of Liberation by Gustavo Gutierrez,    A Theology of Liberation by Gustavo Gutierrez    Jesus and the Disinherited by Howard Thurman   Queer theology The Queer God (God the Homosexual) by Marcella Althaus-Reid    Trans/Formations (Controversies in Contextual Theology) by Marcella Althaus-Reid    Eve Sedgwick   Body theology and thoughts on the incarnation    Disability theology Avery\u0026rsquo;s list + paper    Hull, John M.

Despite being a little outdated in it\u0026rsquo;s language and its lack of focus on the non-binary experience, it is an excellent text, and gives a marvelous introduction to many of the themes of trans and queer theology.\nOne of the things I appreciate about the book is that despite being a good introductory resource, it does not limit itself to purely defensive theology. It rather goes beyond simple scriptural exegesis to explore relevant biblical themes and theological ideas that give spiritual life to trans people. It is also very well researched and its bibliography is a great place to start for people who want to dive into the first works of trans and queer theology.\nThis book should be treated carefully by someone who is not familiar with the language and terminology that the trans community is using today. I would heavily recommend someone who is not familiar with the trans community to educate themselves beforehand, and perhaps read a more modern text, like transforming by Austen Harkte, before tackling this book. I would also recommend non-binary people to read both this and transforming, as transforming has a much greater focus on non-binary experience but this book has a lot of ideas that transforming doesn\u0026rsquo;t tackle.\nChapter List #  1. Trans Issues #  This chapter starts out with a contextualisation of gender variance in the world, and how it has been viewed in various different cultures and spiritual frameworks. It then goes on to engage briefly with some of the theory that proposes that we should strive for a gender free world. Some terms are then defined, including terms that have fallen out of use such as transsexual and transvestite\n1.Defining Transgender  2. A Search for Our Selves #  In this chapter, anecdotes are used to demonstrate the pain and hurt that trans people often go through before and after coming out. Various narratives are considered, both people who knew they were trans from a young age and people who only realized as adults.\n1. Childhood 2. Adolescence 3. Adulthood  3. Gender Variance and the Scriptures #  This chapter is one of the jewels of the book. It is a very condensed run through of 8 sections of the bible that are relevant to trans people. Both affirming and clobber passages are considered.\n4. Transgender People and Faith Communities #  A listing of a number of experiences of trans people within the following three types of faith community. Is quite depressing really.\n1. Conservative Communities of Faith 2. Mainstream Communities of Faith 3. Gay and Lesbian Communities of Faith  5. Creating a Genuine Welcome for Trans People in Communities of Faith #  Very good practical chapter.\n1. Barriers of Participation 2. Signs of a Welcoming Community  6. Transgender People and God #  1. Encountering God 2. The Image and Gender of God 3. Trans Christology 4. God and the Natural  7. Gender as a Calling #  This is perhaps my favourite chapter in the book. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can summarise it effectively beyond the obvious from the title.\n8. Transgender Body Theology #  Justin takes a holistic view to the body/mind split, saying that trans people should unify their body to their mind, and can do this as people are co-creators with God.\n1. Revelation 2. Unity of Self and Body 3. The Right of Self-Determination  9. Transgender Theological Thought #  This chapter is largely about the power of breaking binaries and why that is important to Christianity.\n1. Beyond Male and Female 2. The Center and the Margins 3. Created and Creating 4. Dynamic and Constant Nature of God and Universe 5. Body and Spirit 6. Eternal and Finite 7.
