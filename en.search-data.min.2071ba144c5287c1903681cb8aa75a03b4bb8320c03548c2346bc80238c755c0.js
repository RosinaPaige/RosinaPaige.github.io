What did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations? Do biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not?\n  With most sins, it wasn’t hard to pinpoint the damage they cause. Adultery violates a commitment to your spouse. Lust objectifies others. Gossip degrades people. But commited same-sex relationships didn’t fit this pattern. Not only were they not harmful to anyone, they were characterized by positive motives and traits instead, like faithfulness, commitment, mutual love, and self-sacrifice.

Despite being a little outdated in it\u0026rsquo;s language and its lack of focus on the non-binary experience, it is an excellent text, and gives a marvelous introduction to many of the themes of trans and queer theology.\nOne of the things I appreciate about the book is that despite being a good introductory resource, it does not limit itself to purely defensive theology. It rather goes beyond simple scriptural exegesis to explore relevant biblical themes and theological ideas that give spiritual life to trans people. It is also very well researched and its bibliography is a great place to start for people who want to dive into the first works of trans and queer theology.\nThis book should be treated carefully by someone who is not familiar with the language and terminology that the trans community is using today. I would heavily recommend someone who is not familiar with the trans community to educate themselves beforehand, and perhaps read a more modern text, like transforming by Austen Harkte, before tackling this book. I would also recommend non-binary people to read both this and transforming, as transforming has a much greater focus on non-binary experience but this book has a lot of ideas that transforming doesn\u0026rsquo;t tackle.\nChapter List #  1. Trans Issues #  This chapter starts out with a contextualisation of gender variance in the world, and how it has been viewed in various different cultures and spiritual frameworks. It then goes on to engage briefly with some of the theory that proposes that we should strive for a gender free world. Some terms are then defined, including terms that have fallen out of use such as transsexual and transvestite\n1.Defining Transgender  2. A Search for Our Selves #  In this chapter, anecdotes are used to demonstrate the pain and hurt that trans people often go through before and after coming out. Various narratives are considered, both people who knew they were trans from a young age and people who only realized as adults.\n1. Childhood 2. Adolescence 3. Adulthood  3. Gender Variance and the Scriptures #  This chapter is one of the jewels of the book. It is a very condensed run through of 8 sections of the bible that are relevant to trans people. Both affirming and clobber passages are considered.\n4. Transgender People and Faith Communities #  A listing of a number of experiences of trans people within the following three types of faith community. Is quite depressing really.\n1. Conservative Communities of Faith 2. Mainstream Communities of Faith 3. Gay and Lesbian Communities of Faith  5. Creating a Genuine Welcome for Trans People in Communities of Faith #  Very good practical chapter.\n1. Barriers of Participation 2. Signs of a Welcoming Community  6. Transgender People and God #  1. Encountering God 2. The Image and Gender of God 3. Trans Christology 4. God and the Natural  7. Gender as a Calling #  This is perhaps my favourite chapter in the book. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can summarise it effectively beyond the obvious from the title.\n8. Transgender Body Theology #  Justin takes a holistic view to the body/mind split, saying that trans people should unify their body to their mind, and can do this as people are co-creators with God.\n1. Revelation 2. Unity of Self and Body 3. The Right of Self-Determination  9. Transgender Theological Thought #  This chapter is largely about the power of breaking binaries and why that is important to Christianity.\n1. Beyond Male and Female 2. The Center and the Margins 3. Created and Creating 4. Dynamic and Constant Nature of God and Universe 5. Body and Spirit 6. Eternal and Finite 7.
